Summer 1994 

As the sun sets behind the horizon,\\
Where, where can a swallow take a rest?\\
I have been rushing all the way,\\
From the sunrise to the sunset,\\
From the East to the West,

I brush the sky with lilac;\\
I wrap the rain with velvet.\\
I catch the wind with sorrow;\\
I taste the stream with solitude.\\
Once I walked with Satan;\\
He promised me a rosy garden.\\
I will never age as long as the rose did not wither.

Libido is running like a snake;\\
A little bit, a little bit\\
Open it, open it, Pandora, Pandora\\
The moon waxed red;\\
The star grew cynic.\\
The Jews are still waiting,\\
Waiting for the arrival of the promised Messiah.

But who\\
At such a sleepless night,\\
Is palying an autumn score from far away?\\
I recall that you play the saxophone in the wind;\\
It vaguely tells a dream, an ideal,\\
Through the infinite sands of the Ganges\\
As the sun rises from the mountain,\\
I shall . . .
