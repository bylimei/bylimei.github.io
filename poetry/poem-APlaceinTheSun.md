title: A Place in the Sun

A place in the sun\\
So I could think of you\\
Think of you\\
Like the morning dew\\
On the green green grass\\
Think of you\\
Like the white cloud\\
In the blue blue sky


I first saw you\\
In a shade, under a tree\\
A smile on the face\\
An air of self-sufficient\\
A stream of tenderness\\
An electron of sensation

How is the Tomb like?\\
Like a square inch of my heart\\
Trembling, shivering\\
With delight\\
With temptation


“After a meal, either a woman or a cigarette.  He always chooses to have a cigarette.” \\
“I am smoking but actually I am thinking about you.” \\
A laughter\\
Neverously\\
Thrillingly


“Three thousnd of feeble water I will only take a handful for drink.”\\
Are you the water of the handful\\
Or\\
A unlashed tenderness of my affection


The star getting dim\\
The night getting short\\
Sad and tender\\
Tender and Sad\\
In watching\\
In touching\\
In kissing\\
In parting


A place in the sun\\
So I could think of you\\
Think of you\\
As holding your hands\\
Titi tata\\
Walking on the street\\
Think of you\\
As riding on a motorbike with you\\
In the wind\\
In the dust
