title: An Autumn Afternoon

1996-09-15


An autumn afternoon\\
You walked into my little garden\\
With an orange branch

I asked you\\
Do you know the mountain where peach flowers blossom?\\
You told me the orange branch was a gift from Faust\\
He was digging, he was still digging,\\
Power, knowledge, and ambition

Aroma of orange was in the air\\
I invited you for cappuccino\\
You caressed the orange branch with big affection

Can you hear\\
The breeze was spreading all over my rosy garden?\\
Can you see\\
The sunshine was woven into my blue skirt?\\
Can you smell\\
I used purple color to write you a poem?

Our talk tasted like a spring water\\
You asked for a turkey sandwich\\
I promised to bring you a branch of peach flower\\
If you know the mountain where the peach flowers blossom\\
Maybe you preferred an orange branch

I was aware\\
You did not know the mountain where the peach flowers blossom\\
Maybe we still could have a chocolate cake together\\
On an autumn afternoon
