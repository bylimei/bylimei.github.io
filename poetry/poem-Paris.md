1995

You said, you were leaving\\
Leaving for Paris\\
Paris, what can Paris promise you?\\
An opera ticket?\\
A passionate kiss in the rain?\\
An entangling romance on the stage?

All stories have been told\\
All fairy tales have been written\\
Even the moon has become bitter\\
Bitter about my shadow

My shadow is scattered all over your temptation\\
Your temptation comes along with a sword, a rose, a question\\
A question like a cocoon\\
A concoon gives no promise\\
I either become a butterfly\\
Or\\
I will drink out your temptation\\
I will believe your promise

You promise to give me a rose\\
A rose with a tender tear\\
A tear from a spider woman\\
A spider woman lives in a tropical island\\
One day there came a perfect stranger\\
A stranger with a sword\\
A sword from a knight\\
A knight like Don Quixote

I will dance with you\\
I will invite you to my last seduction\\
I will promise you a sword, a rose, a question\\
The spider woman bursts into a laughter\\
A laughter turns into a tear\\
A tear caresses a rose\\
A rose penerates a sword

You say, you are leaving\\
Leaving for a tropical island\\
Where lives a perfect stranger . . .
