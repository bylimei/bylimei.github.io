Last night\\
You came to see me\\
With a purple flower\\
And a tale of summer dream

Piles and piles of wood\\
Buring high in the firepace\\
Thousands and thousands of snow flower\\
Cheering up outside my windown\\
I used tear, joy and vinegar\\
To make you winter tea

You told me\\
The place called Eroland\\
Where simplicity and affection were virtue\\
Apple green and earthy yellow were the dominant color of a year\\
You walked into a forest of dogwood trees\\
Hundreds and hundreds of little white flower\\
Flirting around the air\\
A stream of Ero river\\
Running through the forest

You did not tell me where the purple flower came from\\
I intended to tell you once you were in my dream\\
As you were narrating the tale of a summer dream\\
Feeling and emotion were disappearing\\
Was I in your tale of a summer dream\\
Or \\
Were you in my winter night's dream . . .
