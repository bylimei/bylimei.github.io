title: Can We Sit and Talk . . .
---

1996-10-26

Can we sit, and talk, and laugh?\\
Talk about what is wrong with the moon tonight;\\
Laugh at why feeling and emotion are becoming such bad terms.

Can we sit, and talk, and share?\\
Talk about my dream, as well as your ambition;\\
Share our joy and sorrow, our longing and frustration.

Can we sit, and talk, and understand?\\
Talk about why beautiful things must drift away;\\
Understand the essence of sense and sensitivity.

Can we sit, and talk, and cry?\\
Talk about whether the fish in the water is happy or not?\\
Cry for simplicity becoming complicate.

I will not ask you to read things through my mind;\\
Shall you not ask me to see things through your eyes.\\
If you are thinking of me as I am thinking of you\\
Here and now,\\
You might realize even the night feels not at home.\\
If you never attempt to invite me to your party;\\
Why shall I tell you the tale of tenderness and love?

Aren't you even afraid of hearing about 'love?'\\
Shall we start calculating, measuring, and numbering:\\
Be practical, be rational, and be a good worker\\
In this damn fucking world\\
Where sharing and caring are becoming burdens, problems.

I do not ask for a dozen of roses;\\
Why do you even deny my entry into your garden?\\
Am I the threat, the other of your space?\\
Can you really read my name?\\
Do you really know what I am looking for?\\
Are you sure how I look like?\\
Can you feel how I feel?\\
Do you understand my emotion of emotion?\\
If you were not the fish in the water;\\
How would you know if the fish were happy or not?

Once you gave me a stone;\\
I still keep it in my pocket.\\
And I remember,\\
You used to carry a great sense of understanding\\
And easiness.\\
If you open your mind;\\
At least you will notice how beautiful the moon is tonight.\\
And maybe we can laugh, share, understand, and cry . . .
