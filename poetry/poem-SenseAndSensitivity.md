title: Sense and Sensitivity
---

1996-09

In your eyes,\\
I see a paradise.\\
Kindness is a fish,\\
Swimming in a golden pond.\\
Gentleness is your wing,\\
Fly, fly, keep flying;\\
Don't worry about the boundary.\\
Don't think about the temporality.\\
The sky, the earth, the universal;\\
All are underneath.

I will follow your imagination.\\
No more is my sadness;\\
No more is any exploitation.\\
I love him (Basquiat)\\
Caring such a sensitivity:\\
'I do not like to exploit anyone.'

Starry is the night;\\
The pumpking is a rich color of Saturday afternoon\\
In Eastern Market\\
The cosmopolitan meets the local\\
Here comes an autumn wind,\\
An afternoon rain\\
Yes, I will remember,\\
I will remember your sense and\\
Sensitivity
