Blue, blue, blue\\
Paint a blue sky\\
Brush a blue seagull\\
Make a fruit salad\\
With\\
Straberries from the basket\\
Green apples from the garden\\
Taste\\
With delight\\
With sunshine

Green, green, green\\
Lie on the grass\\
Smell the rose\\
Think of a few lines\\
With\\
Sunflowers shooting high high high\\
Snow peas climbing up up up

Feel, feel, feel\\
With Breeze\\
With joy

Dream, dream, dream\\
As beautiful as a butterfly\\
As free as a flying bird\\
Summer, heat, watermelon\\
Color, dust, sugar cane\\
Smile, ice, coconut\\
Kaza kaza\\
Walk with a dream\\
Tita tita\\
Love in a dream
