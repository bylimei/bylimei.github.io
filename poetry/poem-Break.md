Break, broke, broken\\
Break,\\
Break deep down, deep down, deep down\\
Pass, past, passed\\
Pass\\
People past by, time passed by

Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps you will know\\
You will know\\
I see the silence of your silence; I see the eloquence of your eloquence\\
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps you will be deceived\\
You will be deceived by\\
My erotic of eroticism; my erotic of eroticism

Perhaps\\
I will give you an orange branch\\
Perhaps\\
Cross mind and mind, time and space, future and past\\
In a mirror, undre a tree

Perhaps\\
I will tell you a story, a story about a fish, a fish living in a water\\
Perhaps\\
I will not tell you a story, a story about a fish, a fish living in a water

Perhaps\\
I will give you a fish, a story, an orange branch\\
Perhaps\\
I will ask you\\
Do you know the fish, the story, the orange branch?\\
Empty is empty; full is full\\
In the wind; in the rain
